# CS-305-Software-Security

•	Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a financial institution that provides various financial services to their clients worldwide. Their goal was to increase security and modernize their current software. They specifically wanted to address the issues regarding secure communications over the internet with the user of a checksum verification. Additionally, Artemis Financial wanted to add more security to their archived files that would be stored on their servers. Lastly, they wanted us to identify any security vulnerabilities within their current software and suggest solutions to those vulnerabilities.

•	What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

During this project I feel like I was able to provide adequate solutions to the software vulnerabilities that were found within the dependency check. Using the provided links that were in the dependency check it was possible to find fixes to the various software issues. This is important for the client since mitigation of software issues is very important. Coding securely ensures the safety of the program. User data, as well as host data are at risk when not placing security at the forefront of the program. In addition to protecting data, the integrity of the program is at risk when not coding securely. The reputation of our company is also at risk when leaving code vulnerable to attack. All of these mentioned contribute to a company thriving in a hostile environment. Data security is at a premium in our digital age. Having proper security in place ensures that a company can continue to grow and thrive. Customers can feel safe knowing that this company is doing all it can to protect their information. 

•	What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

What I found most helpful about working through the vulnerability assessment is that one issue can cause many more issues. For example, one vulnerability may open the program up to attack from many different angles, or cause data to leak from many different areas. Know this will keep me much more vigilant in ensuring that the proper methods are used to protect the program, and in turn, protect user data. 

•	How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

I found that the best way to do this would be to run a dependency check and find any vulnerabilities within the program. However, just doing this is not enough to ensure that the program will be secure. Going through the various amounts of information about each vulnerability is key to making sure that the proper method of mitigation is implemented. Additionally, suppressing vulnerabilities that do not have any king of fix is important when identifying issues that can be fixed. These are some techniques that I will continue to carry with me throughout my career in the computer science field. 

•	How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

First, I would run a dependency check. Saving that file as a “before” file was the easiest way to keep track of the file. Then, after refactoring my code I would run another dependency check and see if any new vulnerabilities were introduced. Comparing the two files lets me get a visual of any new issues that may have arisen after refactoring. If anything did come up, I know it was an issue with something within the refactored code. For the code itself I made sure that the code would execute with no errors. This told me that the syntax as well as the logic for the code was functional.

•	What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Testing code early and often is something I have gotten much better at. Instead of coding writing a large block of code then testing, I will now test in smaller sections. This is to prevent future errors as well as narrow down where an error may have occurred. As always independent research on how to implement certain code is something I’m sure I will continue to do. There is always something new to learn and continuing to expand on the knowledge I have gained throughout this course will help me in my future career path. Resources like github will also help me when it comes to learning about common issues or finding solutions to things like vulnerabilities.

•	Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

I think I demonstrated my ability to build working code, as well as troubleshoot any vulnerabilities. Moreover, being thorough in my assessment of different vulnerabilities and their solutions is another area where I took great pride in. This is something that could make or break a program. Being willing to take the necessary time to fully understand the vulnerabilities and find solutions is a skill that I feel I have come to appreciate. Also, showing that I was able to successfully implement a hash function is another area where I feel I excelled. This is another important skill that I’m sure I will use in the future.
